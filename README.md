What is Git and Github?
Git tracks changes in source cord during the process of software development. Github provides a web based GUI that allows muliple people to edit and view source code at once. 
A Repository is used to organize a project with all of the different files. The project can be managed and edited. A reposity can be cloned, to live on your computer as opposed to the web server. The remote version of the reposity is hosted on Github or whatever server is in use.
A Commit is an individual change to a file or a set of files. Commiting changes are important to log so whoever is decided whether or not it should be integrated into the primary branch can compare the source codes. Changes made must be merged into the primary branch. Changes are merged usually with a pull request.
Merging Conflicts can occur when competing commits exist and whoever is looking at the source code must decide which code will be merged into the primary, branch. This can be avoided by fetching. This will allow you to recieve changes before merging into the primary branch. The changes can then be pulled. The process of pull refers to the changes that you want to fetch before merging. You pull changes so your version stays up to date. When changes are made they should be pushed, so everyone can view the commited changes on Github.
