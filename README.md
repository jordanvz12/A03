What is Git and Github?
Git tracks changes in source cord during the process of software development. Github provides a web based GUI that allows muliple people to edit and view source code at once. 
A Repository is used to organize a project with all of the different files. The project can be managed and edited. A reposity can be cloned, to live on your computer as opposed to the web server. 
A Commit is an individual change to a file or a set of files. Commiting changes are important to log so whoever is decided whether or not it should be integrated into the primary branch can compare the source codes. Changes made must be merged into the primary branch. Changes are merged usually with a pull request.
